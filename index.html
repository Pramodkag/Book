    <h1>Chapter 1: A Knock on Destiny's Door</h1>
    <p>Pramod's heart thumped a nervous rhythm against his ribs as he waited outside Asha's home. This wasn't an ordinary visit; it was a meeting arranged by their families, a first glimpse into a potential future. Taking a deep breath, he knocked, anticipation fluttering in his stomach like a trapped butterfly.</p>
    <p>The door creaked open, revealing Asha's radiant smile. Her eyes, the color of warm honey, sparkled with curiosity, and her laughter, like wind chimes in a summer breeze, filled the air. From that moment, Pramod knew something had shifted within him.</p>
    <p>The conversation flowed easily, like a familiar melody hummed by two souls attuned to the same frequency. They discovered shared laughter over childhood pranks, passionate discussions about their dreams, and a comforting silence that spoke volumes about unspoken understanding.</p>
    <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the room, their families exchanged knowing glances. A silent accord was reached, and with trembling hands and whispered promises, Pramod and Asha's destinies intertwined.</p>
